In Windows 11, you can take a screenshot using several methods. Here are the most common ones:

### **1. Print Screen (PrtScn) Key**
   - **PrtScn (Print Screen):** Captures the entire screen and copies it to the clipboard. You need to paste (Ctrl + V) it into an app like Paint or Word.
   - **Alt + PrtScn:** Captures only the active window and copies it to the clipboard.
   - **Win + PrtScn:** Saves a screenshot of the entire screen directly to `Pictures > Screenshots` folder.

### **2. Snipping Tool (Advanced Screenshots)**
   - Press **Win + Shift + S** to open the **Snipping Tool**.
   - Choose between:
     - **Rectangular Snip** (drag to select an area)
     - **Freeform Snip** (draw any shape)
     - **Window Snip** (capture a specific window)
     - **Fullscreen Snip** (capture the entire screen)
   - The screenshot is copied to the clipboard and can be edited in the **Snipping Tool** app.

### **3. Windows + Volume Down (For Tablets)**
   - If you're using a **Surface** or other Windows tablet, press **Windows logo + Volume Down** to take a screenshot (saved in `Pictures > Screenshots`).

### **4. Game Bar (Win + G)**
   - Press **Win + G** to open the **Xbox Game Bar**.
   - Click the **Camera icon** or press **Win + Alt + PrtScn** to take a screenshot (saved in `Videos > Captures`).

### **Where Are Screenshots Saved?**
- **PrtScn (with Win key):** `Pictures > Screenshots`
- **Game Bar:** `Videos > Captures`
- **Snipping Tool:** Clipboard (paste into an app) or manually saved location.
